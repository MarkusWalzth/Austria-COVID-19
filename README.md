#### How long does it take for the number of infections to double?

- ORF reported on 2020-03-12 that doubling was at 2.5 days
- however the the recent [Lancet paper](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30260-9/fulltext) reports 6.4 days after studiying data from China for Dec 31, 2019, to Jan 28, 2020,
- based on ![n(t') =  2n(t)](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=n(t')%20%3D%20%202n(t)), we find ![equation](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=t'%20%3D%20%5Cleft%28%282%28t-t_0%29%5Ep%2B%5Cfrac%7Ba_0%7D%7Bc%7D%5Cright%29%5E%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Bp%7D%20%2B%20t_0)
- the time for infections or deaths to double is thus given by ![t' - t](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=t'%20-%20t)
- Assumes no significant change to mitigation measures 

**Notably** these findings reproduce the ORFs reporting that in Austria around 2020-03-12 doubling was happening every 2.5 days.
